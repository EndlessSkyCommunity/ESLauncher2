### Installation instructions for Mac
#### Additional requirements for Mac ####
**Important**: currently, the launcher works only when run from a console which has access to the full filesystem.
We are working on a solution to overcome this.

#### Instructions ####
- Download the zip to a location of your choice
- Open a Terminal session and navigate to the zip file
- Unzip the launcher (`unzip eslauncher2-x86_64-apple-darwin.zip`)
- mark it as executable (`chmod 755 eslauncher2-x86_64-apple-darwin`)
- run the launcher (`./eslauncher2-x86_64-apple-darwin`)

#### Full Disk Access for the Console ####
- Open *System Preferences*
- Navigate to *Security & Privacy*
- Select the *Privacy* tab
- Scroll down to the item *Full Disk Access*
- If *Terminal* is not present or not ticked, add it or activate the tick box
- To add Terminal:
  * Unlock the settings by clicking on the lock symbol
  * If *Terminal* is not there, click on the plus
  * Navigate to *Applications* -> *Utilities* -> *Terminal*
  * Select it and click *Open*
  * It should now appear in the list, make sure the box before it is ticked
